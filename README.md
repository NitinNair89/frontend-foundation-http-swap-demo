# Frontend Foundation

A production-ready Next.js starter focused on architecture, swap-ability, and long-term maintainability.

This repository is intended to be used as a template for real projects.

---

## What This Starter Solves

- Prevents UI ↔ state coupling
- Prevents UI ↔ transport coupling
- Avoids opinionated tooling lock-in
- Enables long-term evolution

---

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript (strict)
- Tailwind CSS (token-driven)
- Minimal dependencies
- Zero runtime assumptions

Linting, CMS, and state libraries are deliberately excluded.

All major systems are **replaceable by design**.

---

## Documentation

- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
- [Tailwind Architecture](docs/tailwind-architecture.md)
- [State and Data](docs/state-and-data.md)

These explain the why, not just the how.

## Who This Is For

- Senior frontend engineers
- Teams building long-lived products
- Developers targeting global markets
- Engineers who value architectural clarity
